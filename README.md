Hi! Iâ€™m Brandon Mork, a full-stack software engineer & engineering manager who is passionate about humane technology and creating excellent software.

I hope to contribute to a world where our technologies support individual well-being and societal flourishing. We've got a long way to go, and we need passionate technologists to recognize today's problems and contribute to tomorrow's solutions. For a more comprehensive problem statement and possible solutions, check out [The Center for Humane Technology](https://www.humanetech.com/take-control).

I'm working for [Abrigo](https://www.abrigo.com/company/), a rapidly growing mid-sized FinTech company with an excellent culture and an inspiring mission: helping communities thrive. Abrigo provides technologies for community financial institutions and credit unions, to keep those institutions healthy and focused on supporting their local businesses and communities, in ways monolithic financial institutions cannot.

Abrigo is hiring! [Check out our open positions](https://www.abrigo.com/company/careers/).

I'm always looking for promising projects in the humane technology space to collaborate on. Connect with me over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-mork/) or at my personal email: mork.brandon@gmail.com.
